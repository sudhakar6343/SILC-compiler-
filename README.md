# SILC-compiler-
A simple compiler for a simple and strongly typed language

l.l - This is a lex file ..to identify the tokens and the keywords in the source program
y.y - This is a yacc file to form the abstract syntax tree from the tokens sent by the lex file

The remaining files are used to generate the assembly code for the source program .
Assembly code is for a simulated machine (execute sim file in the repository for simulating the machine).
